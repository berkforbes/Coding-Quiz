# Javascript-Quiz

This Javascript quiz was created using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. When the user selects the Start Quiz button they are presented with the first of 5 questions about Javascript. A timer also begins counting down in the upper right hand corner. Incorrect answers will deduct 10 seconds from the timer. The game finishes when either the user has completed all of the questions or the timer gets to 0. Highscores are ranked based on time remaining.
